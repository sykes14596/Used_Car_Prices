# Predicting Used Car Prices

The goal of this project was to be able to accurately predict the sale price of a range of used cars, as well as to practice skills and techniques learned through the completion of Jose Portilla's "Python for Data Science Bootcamp" on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/17739846?start=0). 

A wide range of models were implemented and the effect of scaling data was investigated. The most accurate model, based on its Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), was a Random Forest Regressor trained and tested on the scaled version of the dataset. The model achieved an R2 score of 96.4% and a RMSE of Â£1858.
